# SPONTANEOUS GENERATION

### 100th anniversary of the Modern Art Week of 1922

About to celebrate a century, the modernist movement of 1922 changed the conception of art in Brazil. One of his sons, the Manifesto Antropófago from Oswald de Andrade in 1928, says:

_"Only Cannibalism unites us. Socially. Economically. Philosophically. The unique law of the world. The disguised expression of all individualisms, all collectivisms. Of all religions. Of all peace treaties. Tupi or not tupi that is the question. Against all catechisms. And against the mother of the Gracchi. I am only interested in what's not mine. The law of men. The law of the cannibal."_

The movement was a success, and since then we have been good anthropophages: we eat well and have a little of everything. We created samba, bossa nova, new cinema. Mangue beat, funk and axé. But what comes now, if not indigestion followed by drowsiness, in addition to an uncomfortable apathy.

Enough eating! Below the banquets, the food courts of the mall, the plastic bottles, the fast food with bad soundtrack. IT'S TIME TO VOMIT!

Abiogenesis, archebiosis. From putrefaction, SPONTANEOUS GENERATION. It no longer matters what is not ours. Tupi or not tupi, that still is the question

A movement without purpose; sum of the non-conformed subjectivities of irrelevant and unknown individuals; that is born out of nowhere and goes who knows where: SPONTANEOUS GENERATION. This is the name of the artistic movement now launched through this manifesto: SPONTANEOUS GENERATION - 100th anniversary of the Modern Art Week of 1922.

Our culture doesn't need flags, you can keep them. Even against all catechisms, only SPONTANEOUS GENERATION matters.

Non-partisan, but political movement, since all external thoughts are political. The movement is peaceful. Our weapon is art. We are against ignorance and denial; in favor of freedom and love. Reaching a single reader, already changes the world and makes the movement.
